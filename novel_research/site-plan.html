        A Central Information Site for Writers
          This website aims to be a central place of information that writers can go to in order to enhance the accuracy of their own creative works. Since many writers don’t need the key details of every little thing, this site will provide an overview on a variety of topics—just the basics that anyone would need to know if they were to write about it in passing. 
        A Connection to Other Valid Sources
          Yet, there will also be links to other websites and resources that have even more information on the topic, so the researcher, if desiring to look deeper into the subject, may know where to find it and will be able to do so through an already validated source. 
        A Basic Overview of Topics with Referrals to Greater Depth
          Once again, the aim of this site is to provide the basic, fundamental information that writers would need regarding a particular topic, and connect them to the right resources to further learn. I can’t write everything about every topic, and the researchers wouldn’t want to dig through mountains of detail just so they can describe a passing chapter with greater accuracy. This site aims to give them what they need and what they want. 
        Climates, Architecture, and Occupations
          Some of the topics that this website will address will include different climates (with their subcategories), structures and architecture, as well as occupations. So for instance, under the categories of occupations, I may have a long list with a table of contents to the side of different jobs. Each will have about a paragraph or two describing an overview. If one of the occupations was a blacksmith, the section would give a definition of what it was, who would do it, why they’d do it, the conditions and environment of the job, an overview of the tools they’d use and the process that blacksmithing would go through. At the bottom of the paragraph I would put some links to more resources the researcher could delve to, like www.medieval-life-and-times.info/medieval-life/medieval-blacksmith.htm which is a site that has lots of more information about medieval blacksmiths.

      <h3>Climates</h3>
      <p>

        Climate Subsections
          On a different hand, the climate section would be a place writers can read more into all the different climates, their conditions, the weather, landforms, plants, and animals that accompany each. One website I’d use is “scijinks.gov/climate-zones/”, which is a professional and accurate source. Some of the information that can be included is written as follows: 
        Tropical: 
          Hot and humid. Average temperatures: greater than 64 degrees Fahrenheit all year. 
        Dry: 
          Moisture is rapidly evaporated from the air. Little precipitation. 
        Temperate: 
          Typically warm and humid summers along with thunderstorms and mild winters. 
        Continental: 
          Warm to cool summers. Very cold winters. During the winter, this area can have snowstorms, strong winds, and temperatures falling below -22 degrees Fahrenheit. 
        Polar: 
          Extremely cold. In the summer, the temperatures never go higher than 50 degrees Fahrenheit.

      <h3>Architectural Styles</h3>
      <p>
        Architectural Styles
          Another section will talk about the different types of architecture and their respective elements. Pictures, of course, will accompany these. These styles were derived from the website “Most Recognized Architectural Styles – Barker Associates”. 
        “Greek and Roman Classical Architecture”. 
          Prominently used in ancient Greece and Rome. It adheres to the idea of building structures with a set template. The order of Greek columns: Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian. 
        “Gothic Architecture”. 
          This style began in France and was adapted throughout Europe. It follows stonework/masonry with three main features: sharply pointed arches, ribbed and vaulted columns, and flying buttresses. 
        “Baroque”. 
          This style originated in Italy and is said to be a more emotional and dramatic style aimed at appealing to the senses. It includes curved forms like ovals, concave and convex forms (suggesting motion), along with distortion (which built certain things to stand out from others). 
        “Neoclassical Architecture”. 
          A revival of Classical architecture, being similar to the Greek and Roman forms. Its style involves clean, elegant lines, an uncluttered appearance, free-standing columns and massive buildings. 
        “Victorian Architecture”. 
          A style that came from the buildings constructed during Queen Victoria’s reign. It was a revival of several architectural styles like Gothic, Romanesque, and Tudor. It was applied to residential housing during the industrial revolution. A feature called the “dollhouse” look includes having elaborate trims, vivid colors and asymmetrical designs.
